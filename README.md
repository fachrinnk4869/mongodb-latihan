To create a `Makefile` that simplifies running your application and a `README.md` file to guide users, here's how you can proceed:

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make (optional but recommended for easier commands)

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Start the Services

To start the MongoDB container with Docker Compose, simply run:

```bash
make up
```

This will start the services in detached mode (`-d`).

### 2. Stop the Services

To stop and remove the Docker Compose services, run:

```bash
make down
```

### 3. Rebuild the Services

If you make changes to the Docker setup or want to force a rebuild of the containers, use:

```bash
make rebuild
```


## Project Structure

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the MongoDB service.
- **`Makefile`**: Provides simple commands for common tasks.
- **`dump/`**: Stores MongoDB data dumps.

## License

### Summary:
- **`Makefile`**: Simplifies running Docker Compose commands like `make up` to start the services.
- **`README.md`**: Explains how to use the `Makefile` commands and provides an overview of the project setup.

With these in place, running the app and managing the MongoDB instance is much simpler!
